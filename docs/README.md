#### Pre-Recorded Submissions

Some tournaments may allow for pre-recorded speech submissions for select events. Make sure you strictly follow the instructions provided. Systems are in place to limit the amount of time competitors have to record these speeches; evading these limits constitutes cheating. Recordings must be re-done for each tournament.

1. Open the "Speech Video Submissions" page under the "Speech" tab. Make sure that you are logged into the website with your member account, failure to do so may result in disqualification. Let the page completely load before you continue.
2. Select your speech event from the dropdown menu. Note that you can only pre-record one speech at a time (if you have multiple entries, do this proccess with one entry, then refresh your page and repeat with your second entry).
3. Open a new tab and conduct an internet speed test (this can be done via a simple Google search). Provide your approxiamte download and upload speeds.
4. Once you are ready to start recording your speech, click the "Generate My Code" button.
5. Record your speech. Make sure you say your name, school, event, date of recording and code at BOTH the start and end of your speech. (ex: I'm John Doe from Interlake High School. This is my Humorous Interp speech, recorded on Saturday, Sept 21st at 9:43 AM. My code is 10JF8A)
6. Once you are done recording your speech, click the "Ready to Submit" button. A "Click to Upload" button should appear.
7. Click on the upload button. This should open a Dropbox file request. Upload your video file here.

> **IMPORTANT NOTE** - the Dropbox file request has a deadline to prevent cheating. This deadline is calculated based on your internet speed and will be displayed to you when you generate your code. The upload must be COMPLETE by the time this deadline passes, or else your speech upload will not go through. This means that, barring any technical difficulties, you CANNOT record your speech more than two times. (this prevents students from having an infinite amount of time to prepare recordings).

## Background

### About us

Hello! I'm Tanush, a junior at Interlake High School, and I'm going to giving you a short demo of an online debating platform that my school's speech and debate team has put together.

### Why 

Before we get started, this platform is aimed at providing a powerful, affordable and accessible option for schools wishing to continue their speech and debate activities despite coronavirus restrictions. We've added numerous layers of security to prevent unwanted disruptions. On top of this, various design elements ensure that students with poor internet connection and limited access to technological resources retain access. The overall process has also been streamlined and automated where possible to provide a simple, seamless experience.

### Basics

Alright, let's jump into this. At the most basic level, our website is a landing point from from which students can join online Microsoft Teams meetings.

## Wix Site

### Signing Up

First, navigate to our [website](https://interlaketournaments.wixsite.com/home). Everyone must sign-up to become a website member. The sign-up form asks for some basic information that allows us to identify the user. Tournaments can opt to include checkboxes about rules or guidelines.

#### Security

These sign-ups must be manually approved by an admin. These simple member sign-ups act as the first line of defense against unwanted strangers disrupting tournaments. 

#### Community Engagement
