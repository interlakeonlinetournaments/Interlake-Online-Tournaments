## Background

### About us

Hello! I'm Tanush, a junior at Interlake High School, and I'm going to giving you a short demo of an online debating platform that my school's speech and debate team has put together.

### Why 

Before we get started, this platform is aimed at providing a powerful, affordable and accessible option for schools wishing to continue their speech and debate activities despite coronavirus restrictions. We've added numerous layers of security to prevent unwanted disruptions. On top of this, various design elements ensure that students with poor internet connection and limited access to technological resources retain access. The overall process has also been streamlined and automated where possible to provide a simple, seamless experience.

### Basics

Alright, let's jump into this. At the most basic level, our website is a landing point from from which students can join online Microsoft Teams meetings.

### Signing Up

First, navigate to our [website](https://interlaketournaments.wixsite.com/home). Everyone must sign-up to become a website member. The sign-up form asks for some basic information that allows us to identify the user. Tournaments can opt to include checkboxes about rules or guidelines.

#### Security

These sign-ups must be manually approved by an admin. These simple member sign-ups act as the first line of defense against unwanted strangers disrupting tournaments. 

#### Community Engagement
